<h1 id="what-is-volleyball">What is Volleyball?</h1>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that any person can play whether your a girl or boy. When playing volleyball you can use any part of your body however you are not supposed to hold the ball.
    <br> You cannot only hold the ball when you are serving or handling the ball to the other team. When handing the other team a ball you have to roll it under the net. There is a net between you and
    <br> the other team amd you and the other team cannot touch or cross the net. There are 3 sets per game. however when it is finals or a very important game it goes to 5 sets. For the 3 set game you
    <br> have to win 2 sets. To win a set you have to have a total of 25 points. However for a 5 set game the fifth set will be up to 15 points. If it goes to 14 14 or 24 24 for the points there will
    <br> be a tiebreaker whoever has the lead of two points.</p>
