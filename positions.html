<h1 id="positions-in-volleyball">Positions in Volleyball</h1>
<p>There are at least 8 different positions. The 8 positions are outside hitter also known as an all around player they are also called a wing spiker or left side spiker.
    <br> Another position is a setter. A setter needs to get the second ball however if they can't and they got the first ball or the ball is to far usually someone else
    <br> like a defender or anyone else can get the second ball. Usually the libero gets the second ball. Liberos are sometimes short in size and they need to be quick and
    <br> have good reflexes. The libero is a defender. The libero needs to pick up the ball usually the first ball. The libero needs to have good control and needs to pick
    <br> up tips, spikes, and serves. There is also a position called a middle blocker. The middle blocker doesn't hit like the wing spiker he/she hits in the middle and is a
    <br> good blocker. The middle usually is a good jumper, fast, or a tall person. A middle blocker is sometimes used as a decoy for the ace to come in. The ace is sometimes
    <br> the right side hitter or wing spiker. There is also a position called a pinch server. A pinch server switches out with a middle blocker and has to have a hard serve,
    <br> soft serve, a floating serve, or even a jump serve. a hard serve is where it is almost out but it is on the line. You need good control and need to be relaxed and calm.
    <br> A soft serve is a serve that hits the net and falls onto the court witch is called a short. A floating serve is where the ball you see moves in different directions. A
    <br> jump serve you just jump and serve however the timing needs to be correct and there needs to be a course where the serve curves.</p>
