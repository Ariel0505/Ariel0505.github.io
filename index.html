<h2 class="what-is-volleyball">What is volleyball?</h2>
<p>Volleyball is a sport where you can use any part of your body however you are not supposed to hold the ball. You cannot only hold the ball when you are serving or handling the ball to the other team.
<br> When handing the other team a ball you have to roll it under the net. There is a net between you and the other team amd you and the other team cannot touch or cross the net.
<br> There are 3 sets per game. however when it is finals or a very important game it goes to 5 sets. For the 3 set game you have to win 2 sets. To win a set you have to have a total of 25 points.
<br> However for a 5 set game the fifth set will be up to 15 points. If it goes to 14 14 or 24 24 for the points there will be a tiebreaker whoever has the lead of two points. </p>
<h2>Positions in Volleyball</h2>
<p>There are at least 8 different positions. The 8 positions are outside hitter also known as an all around player they are also called a wing spiker or left side spiker.
<br> Another position is a setter. A setter needs to get the second ball however if they can't and they got the first ball or the ball is to far usually someone else
<br> like a defender or anyone else can get the second ball. Usually the libero gets the second ball. Liberos are sometimes short in size and they need to be quick and
<br> have good reflexes. The libero is a defender. The libero needs to pick up the ball usually the first ball. The libero needs to have good control and needs to pick
<br> up tips, spikes, and serves. There is also a position called a middle blocker. The middle blocker doesn't hit like the wing spiker he/she hits in the middle and is a
<br> good blocker. The middle usually is a good jumper, fast, or a tall person. A middle blocker is sometimes used as a decoy for the ace to come in. The ace is sometimes
<br> the right side hitter or wing spiker. There is also a position called a pinch server. A pinch server switches out with a middle blocker and has to have a hard serve,
<br> soft serve, a floating serve, or even a jump serve. a hard serve is where it is almost out but it is on the line. You need good control and need to be relaxed and calm.
<br> A soft serve is a serve that hits the net and falls onto the court witch is called a short. A floating serve is where the ball you see moves in different directions. A
<br> jump serve you just jump and serve however the timing needs to be correct and there needs to be a course where the serve curves.</p>
